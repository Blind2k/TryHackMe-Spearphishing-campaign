# TryHackMe-Spearphishing-campaign
“Act like the person you want to become” - Ruben Chavez.

Inspired by the <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/phishingyl">phishing campaign</a> in the red team path, I devised a plan to get the TryHackMe users credentials… Muha ha HA!

At first: I checked which Emails THM actually sending to the user. Most of them were conventional, like every website with user registration: Email address verification and password reset. Only after a conversation in a Reddit thread, I got this idea - A FRIEND REQUEST!

So I made this Email. Sadly setting up an Email server so I couldn’t finish the mail headers that fit the project.

I preferred “www.tryheckme.com”
Other typosquatting possibilities: “www.trylackme.com”, “www.tryhackme.corn”
